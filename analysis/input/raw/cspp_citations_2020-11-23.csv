biennium_b,1925-2016,First year of the biennium (no KY),"First year of the biennium a year belongs to. Bienniums are thought to start in the year after an election in (often) even numbered years. For example, 1971-1972 is the biennium in OR after the 1970 election. Then '1971' would appear in both 1971 and 1972 for OR. This considers KY a 'normal state' after it switched to even-year elections for the state legislature.","Klarner, Carl, 2013, 'Governors Dataset', https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PQ0Y1N, Harvard Dataverse, V1",government,"Klarner, Carl.

If a governor was sitting in a state with no term limits, when a constitutional amendment passed that created a two term term limit author assumed that the counter would start when the constitutional amendment passed. Some of the state specific notes for this variable may not appear below, but in the document 'GovTermLimits-PrimaryDocuments.' If the term limit in NC in 1997 was an absolute limit, then James B.

While these policies receive 'constitutional weights' boosting them by a factor of 10 because of their First Amendment implications, they receive low weights even so because there is not much evidence that contribution limits reduce private actors’ involvement in politics, unless the limits are extremely low (and Vermont’s extremely low limits were struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2006).","Mercatus Center. 2016.

This index basically reflects the extent to which a state’s tight asset forfeiture rules encourage revenue-sharing with the Department of Justice. Tight rules are indeed better, since the government should not take private property simply because it was allegedly used in a crime or allegedly constitutes proceeds of a crime, unless the owner of the property is found culpable in a court of law and the seizure is used to compensate victims. But as the Institute for Justice study found, tight rules simply encourage forfeiture by the federal government.","Mercatus Center. 2016. 'Freedom in the 50 States.'

nofelons,1980-2018,Number of felons ineligible to vote,The total number of felons who are ineligible to vote.,"McDonald, Michael P. United States Election Project. Turnout 1980–2012. http://www.electproject.org/
Originally provided by Stateminder: A data visualization project from Georgetown University. www.stateminder.org (no longer accessible online)
Notes: The number of ineligible felons depends on state law. Some states permanently disfranchise felons and a few let even prisoners vote. Statistics drawn from various Department of Justice reports which detail the prison, probation, and parole population of the United States are matched with these state laws to estimate the number of ineligible felons. The Department of Justice Bureau, Office of Justice Statistics releases numbers from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31 for a given year. Author uses the most approximate Jan. 1 values, where available, since these include revised Dec. 31 data from the previous year. Author assumes all Prisoners and Parolees are felons, and half of Probationers are felons (this estimate is drawn from DOJ reports; starting in 2011, DOJ reports the number of persons on probation who are felons). A blank or zero indicates the category of felons is allowed to vote in that state. For the United States totals, author includes persons in the federal corrections system.",elections,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Notes: VEP Highest Office Turnout Rate = (Voted for Highest Office) / (Voting-Eligible Population Total) (recommended statistic).
The Vote for Highest Office is the traditional reported number of people who voted in a given election. In presidential election years, the vote for highest office is simply the presidential vote. In a non-presidential election year, the vote for highest office is the largest vote total for a statewide office such as governor or US Senator. When no statewide office is on the ballot, the sum of the congressional races is used instead. In 2006, the methodology was changed slightly to use the sum of the congressional races if they exceeded a statewide office, as occurred with Indiana’s uncompetitive US Senate race.",elections,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some data originally provided by Stateminder: A data visualization project from Georgetown University. www.stateminder.org (no longer accessible online)
Notes: Total energy average price is derived by dividing the total energy total expenditures in the residential sector by the total energy consumed by the residential sector, across each state, and multiplying the result by a thousand. Data is adjusted for process fuel, intermediate products, and fuels with no direct cost. Residential sector is defined as an energy-consuming sector that consists of living quarters for private households. Energy is defined as the capacity for doing work as measured by the capability of doing work (potential energy) or the conversion of this capability to motion (kinetic energy).",environment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
