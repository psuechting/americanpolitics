  congress = 110:112,
  enddate = "2013-04-20")
#> Query '(Iraq) AND (enddate:2013-04-20) AND (congress:110 111 112) AND (chamber:house)' returned 49 rollcalls...

# We can assemble and use these complex queries ourselves. 
# Here's one example where we look for all roll calls with the key words "estate", "death", or "tax" and was held in the 100th to the 114th Congress.

## Voteview search with options

# You can also search for member data using the member_search function.
